Hi! I've optioned for the nickname "BBWally" because of a deep interest in broadband technologies
and the way in which advanced communications is transforming our world. In a past life, I led the
deployment of Australia's most advanced broadband network in the national capital (Canberra) - passing
some 65,000 homes with pre-standards VDSL technology and offering fast internet, streaming and on-demand
video back at the start of the 21st century when 33kbps dial-up was pretty much the standard. This
AUD250m project was certainly one of the highlights of my career.

These days I am semi-retired, but enjoy little projects in the IOT space. I was a software developer
for some 25 years before switching into the telecoms sector - but the languages back in that era (70's, 
80's and 90's) pre-dated object-oriented programming. So I have much learning to rebuild my past 
proficiency as a programmer. I have concentrated on the Arduino IDE and Python for most of the projects.

The broad thrust of my present efforts is to rebuild (at least to proof-of-concept stage) a comprehensive
suite of "smart home" devices that give a good range of functionality without relying on external 
servers. Rather I am using a Raspberry Pi running a suite of applications (Mosquitto for MQTT, influxDB,
Grafana and NodeRed) within my home network, with a secure, encrypted VPN for external access into that
server (and thence on to control of things like remotely opening doors etc).
